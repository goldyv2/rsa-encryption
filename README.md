  # rsa-encryption in 🐍

</div>

A partial, unoptimized and slow implementation of RSA encryption I wrote from scratch in Python just so I could understand the math behind it.

> **This program is NOT to be considered a real or proper implementation of RSA encryption. This was created out of curiosity and to learn by implementing many fundamentals from scratch hence why I didn't just use the algorithms like (gcd) python provides.**
